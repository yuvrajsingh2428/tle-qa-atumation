            - paragraph [ref=e313]: Before TLE’s CP course, I relied on YouTube videos or someone's help to clear my doubts. After the course, I became independent, learning through editorials and getting in the habit of reading blogs on Codeforces and CP algorithms. I am using the CP-31 sheet after the course and it helped me become comfortable with problems up to 1600 rating.

I always thought that consistency is the key, but consistency in the right direction can do wonders. This direction was provided to me by TLE with curated practice problems. I went from a rating of 1100 to 1400+ on Codeforces in the last 3 months.

The best aspect of the course was the doubt-solving sessions, which not only resolved my doubts but also helped me understand what was wrong in my approach. I improved in many concepts thanks to the amazing live classes, and their contests provided valuable insights into my performance throughout the course.

After the course, my growth really took off. I gained over 200 positive deltas, moving from Newbie to Specialist in three months. The mentors are pretty cool and, apart from clearing doubts, they often reviewed my profile and provided guidance on how to reach Specialist. The overall experience there was great.

One of the best aspects of TLE is the comprehensive knowledge it provides on every topic, including complex ones like dynamic programming (DP) and graphs. The doubt support is outstanding, with queries addressed within 5-10 minutes. The practice problems are both educational and challenging, significantly contributing to my progress. Additionally, they provide video solutions for all practice problems. The gamified scoring feature on the course website kept me motivated.

What I loved most about TLE was the massive amount of concepts I learned in a structured manner, which would have been extremely hard to learn on my own. The only thing I regret is not finding out about TLE earlier. If you want to get better at CP, joining TLE is a no-brainer.

Apart from the rating gain, I got clarity about the topics I needed to study, especially string hashing, binary search and graph problems, which would have been very hard to find otherwise. Tutorials are available everywhere but getting to know why my code is failing from the mentors is the most satisfying thing ever and that is the best thing about TLE. Anyone with a will to improve should go ahead with TLE Eliminators.

Through TLE’s Level 3 course, I learned many crucial topics, such as binary search, string hashing, and greedy approach, in a structured format, which led to better results. Within three months, I advanced from Newbie to Specialist rank.
